Domain Layer

1. Course Entity Operations

	•	Test Case 1: Create a Course entity with valid data.
	•	Input: Valid CourseId, CourseTitle, and CourseDuration.
	•	Expected Output: A Course object is instantiated correctly.
	•	Test Case 2: Prevent creation of a Course entity with invalid data.
	•	Input: Null or invalid CourseTitle or CourseDuration.
	•	Expected Output: An exception (e.g., InvalidArgumentException) is thrown.
	•	Test Case 3: Update the attributes of an existing Course entity.
	•	Input: New CourseTitle or CourseDuration.
	•	Expected Output: The entity reflects the updated attributes.
	•	Test Case 4: Delete a Course entity.
	•	Input: A valid Course object.
	•	Expected Output: Entity deletion is confirmed (e.g., through a repository).

2. Value Object Validation and Immutability

	•	Test Case 1: Ensure CourseId, CourseTitle, and CourseDuration cannot be modified after creation.
	•	Input: Attempt to change values directly after instantiation.
	•	Expected Output: The value objects remain immutable.
	•	Test Case 2: Validate that CourseId accepts only valid UUIDs.
	•	Input: Pass both valid and invalid UUIDs.
	•	Expected Output: Accept valid UUIDs; throw exceptions for invalid ones.

Application Layer

1. Use Case Logic

	•	Test Case 1: Successfully create a course using CreateCourseUseCase.
	•	Input: Valid command data (CreateCourseCommand).
	•	Expected Output: A CourseCreatedEvent is triggered, and the course is persisted.
	•	Test Case 2: Prevent creation of a course with invalid data.
	•	Input: Invalid CreateCourseCommand (e.g., missing title).
	•	Expected Output: An exception (e.g., ValidationException) is thrown.
	•	Test Case 3: Test UpdateCourseUseCase to ensure attributes are updated.
	•	Input: A valid UpdateCourseCommand.
	•	Expected Output: A CourseUpdatedEvent is triggered, and changes are persisted.
	•	Test Case 4: Delete a course via DeleteCourseUseCase.
	•	Input: A valid DeleteCourseCommand.
	•	Expected Output: The course is removed from the repository.

2. Command and Query Handlers

	•	Test Case 1: Test CreateCourseHandler for successful execution of a command.
	•	Input: Valid CreateCourseCommand.
	•	Expected Output: The handler interacts with the repository to persist the course.
	•	Test Case 2: Test GetCourseByIdHandler for retrieving a course.
	•	Input: Valid CourseId.
	•	Expected Output: The handler fetches the correct course from the repository.
	•	Test Case 3: Validate that SearchCoursesHandler supports filters and pagination.
	•	Input: Search parameters (e.g., title filter, page number).
	•	Expected Output: Returns a list of courses matching the criteria.

3. Event Dispatching

	•	Test Case 1: Ensure CourseCreatedEvent is dispatched when a course is created.
	•	Input: A valid CreateCourseCommand.
	•	Expected Output: The event dispatcher calls all relevant event handlers.

Infrastructure Layer

1. Repository Implementations

	•	Test Case 1: Test EloquentCourseWriteRepository for persisting a course.
	•	Input: Valid Course entity.
	•	Expected Output: The entity is stored in the database.
	•	Test Case 2: Validate EloquentCourseReadRepository for retrieving courses.
	•	Input: Query by CourseId or filters.
	•	Expected Output: Correct data is fetched from the database.

2. Event Bus Functionality

	•	Test Case 1: Ensure RabbitMQEventBus publishes an event to the queue.
	•	Input: Valid domain event.
	•	Expected Output: The event appears in the RabbitMQ queue.
	•	Test Case 2: Test InMemoryEventBus for synchronous event handling during development.
	•	Input: Valid domain event.
	•	Expected Output: The event is handled by all subscribers.

3. Database Migrations

	•	Test Case 1: Ensure the create_courses_table migration creates the required schema.
	•	Input: Run migration.
	•	Expected Output: Database table matches the expected schema.

4. Search Integration

	•	Test Case 1: Validate CourseSearchRepository for indexing and searching courses.
	•	Input: A course entity to index and a search query.
	•	Expected Output: The course is indexed and can be retrieved via Elasticsearch queries.
	•	Test Case 2: Ensure CourseSearchIndexer updates indices when a course is updated.
	•	Input: Updated course data.
	•	Expected Output: The search index reflects the changes.

Presentation Layer

1. HTTP Request Validation

	•	Test Case 1: Validate a CreateCourseRequest with valid input.
	•	Input: Correctly formatted request payload.
	•	Expected Output: Validation passes, and data is forwarded to the use case.
	•	Test Case 2: Reject a CreateCourseRequest with missing or invalid fields.
	•	Input: Incomplete or malformed request payload.
	•	Expected Output: A 422 (Unprocessable Entity) response is returned.

2. API Routes and Responses

	•	Test Case 1: Test the POST /api/courses endpoint for creating a course.
	•	Input: Valid JSON payload.
	•	Expected Output: Returns a 201 status with the created course’s data.
	•	Test Case 2: Test the GET /api/courses/{id} endpoint for retrieving a course.
	•	Input: Valid course ID.
	•	Expected Output: Returns a 200 status with the course data.
	•	Test Case 3: Ensure DELETE /api/courses/{id} removes a course.
	•	Input: Valid course ID.
	•	Expected Output: Returns a 204 status with no content.
	•	Test Case 4: Validate that GET /api/courses supports filters and pagination.
	•	Input: Query parameters for filters and pagination.
	•	Expected Output: Returns a paginated list of courses matching the criteria.

These test cases are designed to ensure robustness, correctness, and adherence to requirements across all layers of the application.
