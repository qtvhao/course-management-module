Here’s a Test-Driven Development (TDD) Guide tailored for implementing the course-management-module. The guide ensures step-by-step progress, starting with test creation and gradually building functionality.

1. Understand Requirements

Before diving into coding, clarify the functionality:
- What should the module do?
    - CRUD operations for courses.
    - Search for courses.
    - Trigger events on certain actions (e.g., course creation).
    - Handle validation and error scenarios.
- Who interacts with it?
    - API clients (via controllers).
    - Other systems (via events).

2. Define Test Cases

Break down the requirements into smaller, testable units:
	1.	Domain Layer:
	•	Create, update, and delete course entities.
	•	Ensure value object immutability and validation.
	2.	Application Layer:
	•	Use case logic (e.g., CreateCourseUseCase).
	•	Command and query handlers.
	•	Event dispatching.
	3.	Infrastructure Layer:
	•	Repository implementations.
	•	Event bus functionality.
	•	Database migrations and search integrations.
	4.	Presentation Layer:
	•	Validate HTTP requests.
	•	Test API routes and responses.

3. Set Up Your Testing Environment

	1.	Choose a Testing Framework:
	•	Use PHPUnit (PHP) for unit and feature testing.
	2.	Install Dependencies:
	•	Ensure libraries like mockery or php-mock for mocking dependencies.
	3.	Configuration:
	•	Create a phpunit.xml configuration file for environment setup.
	4.	Structure Tests:
	•	Organize your tests to mirror your module’s structure:

tests/
├── Unit/
│   ├── Domain/
│   ├── Application/
│   ├── Infrastructure/
│   └── Presentation/
└── Feature/

4. Follow the TDD Cycle for Each Feature

For each feature, follow this iterative TDD process:

Step 1: Write a Failing Test

Start by writing a test that describes the behavior of the feature. For example:
	•	Test Case: Creating a Course

public function testCreateCourseSuccessfully() {
    $command = new CreateCourseCommand(
        'course-id-1',
        'Introduction to TDD',
        '3 hours'
    );
    $handler = new CreateCourseHandler($mockedCourseWriteRepository, $mockedEventDispatcher);

    $result = $handler->handle($command);

    $this->assertEquals('course-id-1', $result->id());
    $this->assertEquals('Introduction to TDD', $result->title());
    $this->assertEquals('3 hours', $result->duration());
}



Step 2: Write Minimal Code to Pass the Test

Implement just enough functionality to make the test pass:
	•	Create the CreateCourseHandler.
	•	Ensure it processes the CreateCourseCommand and uses the repository to persist the course.

Step 3: Refactor

Improve the code without changing its behavior:
	•	Ensure the CreateCourseHandler adheres to clean code practices.
	•	Optimize interactions with the repository.

5. Implement Features Step-by-Step

Use the TDD cycle for each feature. Here’s a roadmap for implementing the module:

Domain Layer

	1.	Entities and Value Objects:
	•	Write tests to ensure that a Course entity:
	•	Requires valid CourseId, CourseTitle, and CourseDuration.
	•	Throws exceptions for invalid inputs.
	•	Example test:

public function testCourseCreationWithInvalidTitleThrowsException() {
    $this->expectException(InvalidArgumentException::class);

    new Course('course-id-1', '', '3 hours');
}


	2.	Domain Events:
	•	Ensure events like CourseCreatedEvent encapsulate the right data.

Application Layer

	1.	Use Cases:
	•	Write tests for CreateCourseUseCase, UpdateCourseUseCase, and DeleteCourseUseCase.
	•	Test edge cases (e.g., duplicate course ID).
	2.	Command Handlers:
	•	Ensure handlers correctly process commands and interact with the domain and infrastructure layers.
	•	Mock repositories to isolate tests.
	3.	Query Handlers:
	•	Test that queries like GetCourseByIdQuery return accurate data.

Infrastructure Layer

	1.	Repositories:
	•	Write tests for EloquentCourseReadRepository and EloquentCourseWriteRepository:
	•	Test CRUD operations with a test database.
	•	Use migrations to ensure the database schema matches expectations.
	•	Example test:

public function testRepositorySavesAndRetrievesCourse() {
    $course = new Course('course-id-1', 'TDD Basics', '2 hours');

    $repository->save($course);

    $retrieved = $repository->findById('course-id-1');
    $this->assertEquals($course, $retrieved);
}


	2.	Event Bus:
	•	Test that the RabbitMQEventBus dispatches events correctly.

Presentation Layer

	1.	Request Validation:
	•	Write tests for CreateCourseRequest to validate user inputs.
	•	Example:

public function testValidationFailsForEmptyTitle() {
    $response = $this->post('/api/courses', ['title' => '', 'duration' => '3 hours']);

    $response->assertStatus(422); // HTTP validation error
}


	2.	Controllers:
	•	Use feature tests to ensure the CourseController integrates with use cases and repositories correctly.
	•	Mock dependencies to focus on controller behavior.

6. Integrate and Test End-to-End

After unit testing individual components:
	1.	Write feature tests to simulate real-world scenarios:
	•	Example: Creating a course, updating it, and verifying the changes via API.
	2.	Mock external systems (e.g., email, caching) where needed.

7. Refactor and Optimize

	1.	Remove duplication in code and tests.
	2.	Ensure all tests pass consistently.
	3.	Use tools like PHPStan or Psalm for static analysis to catch potential issues.

8. Monitor Test Coverage

	1.	Use a code coverage tool (e.g., Xdebug or PHPUnit’s built-in coverage) to measure test completeness.
	2.	Focus on high-priority areas like domain and application logic.

9. Final Steps

	•	Run tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
	•	Share documentation (README.md) for setting up and running tests.

By following this guide, you’ll build a robust, well-tested module that adheres to TDD principles.
